# **Busco_Plot**

## **Motivation**

```
This script has been altered from the original code by Mathieu Seppey available at https://gitlab.com/ezlab/busco/-/tree/master.
Its purpose is to create figures displaying the BUSCO lineage used in processing genomic, transcriptomic, or proteomic files.

Moreover, this module enables the generation of figures in 'jpeg', 'png', or 'tiff' formats.

Lastly, various pieces of code originally spread across different files have been consolidated into one file for simplicity and convenience.

MODULE__NAME:       Busco_Plot.v1.0.0.py
MODULE_VERSION:     1.0.0
MODULE_SYNOPSIS:    This module produces a graphic summary for BUSCO runs based on short summary files

This tool uses the short summary files produces by the Busco tool (https://busco.ezlab.org/ and https://gitlab.com/ezlab/busco/-/tree/master),
and ggplot2 (2.2.0+) (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), to produce and execute a file containing R code needed to produce a figure in either:
    'jpeg' (default), 'png', or 'tiff' formats.

This tool assumes your system is able to run R. It also uses the following R libraries:

    dplyr (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/readme/README.html)
    tidyr (https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)
    forcats (https://forcats.tidyverse.org/)
    Cairo (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Cairo/index.html)

If these libraries are not installed, the tool will attempt to install them.

To use this module place all BUSCO short summary files (short_summary.[generic|specific].dataset.label.txt) in a single directory, and provide
this directory PATH to this module.

The resulting plots will be written in the same directory where the short summary files are present.

You can find both the resulting R script for customisation (if so desired) and the resulting figure in the format requested in the specified directory.

required arguments:
  -wd PATH, --working_directory PATH
                        Define the location of the working directory where the Busco files are located
  -l {Eukaryotic Lineage,Metazoan Lineage}, --lineage {Eukaryotic Lineage,Metazoan Lineage}
                        Define the lineage used when running Busco. Default is 'Eukaryotic Lineage'. Choose between 'Eukaryotic Lineage' or 'Metazoan Lineage'.

optional arguments:
  -f {jpeg,png,tiff}, --file_type {jpeg,png,tiff}
                        select the output file format desired: 'jpeg', 'png', or 'tiff'
  -rt RUN_TYPE, --run_type RUN_TYPE
                        type of summary to use, `generic` or `specific`
  --no_r                To avoid to run R. It will just create the R script file in the working directory
  -q, --quiet           Disable the info logs, displays only errors
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
```
